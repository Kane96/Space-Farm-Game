## Usage

[Link to game (WebGL)](https://kane96.github.io/Space-Farm-Game/)

This is an incomplete farming game where the player plants vegetables and increases their income as their farm expands. The goal is to find the optimal layout for producing the currency known as Credits. Use WASD to move the camera and mouse wheel to scroll in or out. Use CTRL to place a plant without clearing the cursor, and right click to clear the cursor manually. 

## Details

Space Farm Game is an endless farming game made with Unity using C#. This was a small hobby project developed over roughly a week, working in close collaberation with an artist who developed the graphical assets. The player starts off by placing carrots, and after gathering enough Credits they can plant flowers, which enhance the growth speed and yield of the carrots. These effects stack multiplicatively. Find the best layout of flowers and vegetables, be it for profit or for looks!

## Build

In order to build the game, Unity 2019.4.17f1 is required. Later versions can be used but you may see unexpected results. Open the root directory as the project file, navigate to File -> Build Settings -> select your target platform and select Build/Build And Run.
