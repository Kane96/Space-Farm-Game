## Details

Project-B (or City Kitty) is an endless runner game made in Unity using C# as part of a small hobby project, over the timespan of week or so. The difficulty increases as the game goes on. Programming done by me.

## Build

Requires a WebGL-capable browser such as Chrome, Firefox  or Internet Explorer. The game may run on mobile but it is only playable on desktop.
